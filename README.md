An automator to close Music.app

With the recent MacOS Big Sur update, it is impossible to get rid of the useless Apple Music app.

More annoying than this, is that the app automatically starts when connecting bluetooth headphones (not all models apparently).

Since I don't use, and don't need Music, I made this automator to launch at startup to close the app as soon as it opens.

It uses about 7.5 MB of RAM.
